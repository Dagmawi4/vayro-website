          </h2>
          <p className="mt-6 text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            The idea of Vayro was born during my third trip to Las Vegas. Unlike my
            previous visits, which were mainly for conferences, this time I wanted to
            truly explore the city. Las Vegas is overflowing with things to do, but
            without an organized, personalized, and accurate travel guide, I found
            myself overwhelmed.{" "}
            <br /><br />
            What should have been an exciting adventure turned into a stressful
            experience of juggling multiple apps, YouTube videos, TikToks, and random
            websites. Instead of enjoying my trip, I spent most of my energy trying to
            figure out what to do, until it became exhausting. While I managed to see
            a few places, I returned home realizing there had to be a better way.{" "}
            <br /><br />
            From that reflection, the idea of Vayro was born. I wanted an app that
            would allow me to simply land in a city and start enjoying, without the
            stress of logistics. Even in its name, “Vayro” — a blend of “Voyage” and
            “Aero” — symbolizes travel and exploration powered by intelligence.{" "}
            <br /><br />
            From the start, I promised one thing: Vayro will never be just another
            travel app prioritizing affiliates. It will always put travelers first —
            saving their time, energy, and mood by making planning effortless. Travel,
            especially vacations, should be about enjoying the journey, not stressing
            over the details. That is our mission: to transform trip planning into a
            seamless, personalized experience that lets you focus on creating memories.
